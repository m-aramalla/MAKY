    <p>Many people are watching news to keep up with the daily updates of COVID-19. However, nowadays most news can be misleading and fake. We have created a selection of myths that people may believe but are not true.</p>
    
    
    <p>Getting COVID-19 is a death sentence.</p>
<blockquote cite=>
Current information shows that only very few of those who contract this disease will die. This is mainly in the most vulnerable people, those who have an underlying health condition or are in older age. For the majority of those infected, the virus will result in typical Flu symptoms and should be fine with treatment.

<p>Getting COVID-19 is more contagious than the Flu or Measles</p>
<blockquote cite=>
The latest information shows that it more contagious than flu but a lot less than measles. Remember, annually the Flu infects about 1 billion people with over half a million deaths worldwide.

<p>If one person on a plane or in a train has the disease, everyone will be infected.</p>
<blockquote cite=>
The risk is extremely high for those within one metre of an infected person who is coughing or sneezing openly. However, if an individual uses tissues or coughs/sneezes into the elbow region, the risk will be considerably lowered.

<p>Hand gels are the best means of protecting myself.</p>
<blockquote cite=>
While good quality handgels are helpful, careful washing of your hands, avoid touching you face and staying away from those with obvious symptoms(flu like illness, coughing, runny eyes, fever etc) is the best way to avoid contracting the illness.

 <p>Face masks will protect me from contracting COVID-19.</p>
<blockquote cite=>
Unless you are using are very specialized face mask, the air surrounding you will leak in around the edges of the mask and it is just as though you were not using the mask at all. Masks are helpful to catch some of the virus particles from those who already have the disease and are coughing but they need to be changed regularly and very carefully,otherwise they are a risk factor.If you are healthyyou only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person suspected of COVID 19.

 <p>If I buy food in a supermarket and then boil or cook it for our meals that should kill any virus that might be lurking </p>
<blockquote cite=>
This is true but, the problem may be from you handling the food before it is heated. Take care and wash your own hands regularly after touching anything that could have been contaminated. This handwashing advice is hugely recommended after using public transport or after being on an escalator.

 <p>COVID 19 is the most deadly disease to hit mankind.  </p>
<blockquote cite=>
While COVID 19 is spreading quickly, in some regions of the world and has a mortality rate of 2-3%. It is still not by any means as deadly as other diseases. For example, SARS killed 10% of those who became infected and MERS is responsible for between 30-40% of deaths among those who get the disease.

 <p>The new Coronavirus can be transmitted through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting COVID 19 cases.</p>
<blockquote cite=>
Even though COVID 19 can last on surfaces from a few hours up to several days(depending on the type of surface). It is highly unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, travelled and exposed to different conditions and temperatures. If you think a surface maybe contaminated use a disinfectant to clean it. After touching it, clean your hands with a alcohol based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.

 <p>Eating garlic can help prevent infection from the new coronavirus.</p>
<blockquote cite=>
Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However there is no evidence from the current outbreak to suggest that. Eating garlic has protected people from COVID 19.
